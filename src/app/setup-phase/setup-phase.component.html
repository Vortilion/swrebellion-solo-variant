    <h3>Setup</h3>
    <p>
        Use the Advanced Set-up from the Rules with the following changes:
    </p>

    Place Starting Leaders
    Gather the four leaders that do not have a recruit icon and places them in the box labeled “Leader Pool”

    The Empire starts with five Leaders. Recruit the 5th by drawing one Action Card (keep drawing until the Empire acquires the additional Leader)

    Prepare Time Track
    Then place the time marker on space “1” of the track and the reputation marker on space “14” of the track

    Prepare Objective Deck
    Sort the objective cards into three piles based on the number shown on the card back (I, II, or III)

    Remove the “Heart of the Empire” (Level II) Objective card

    Draw one card from the objective deck

    Prepare Action Decks
    Gather all action cards that have a recruit icon and shuffle them to create two action decks. Place them facedown next to each faction sheet on the side
    labeled “Action Deck.”

    Prepare Mission Cards
    Starting Missions: Starting mission cards are identified by a curved arrow at the bottom of the card. For both sides take four starting mission cards and
    set them aside.

    Remaining Missions: For both sides take the remaining mission cards and shuffles them to create the mission deck. Place it facedown next to each faction
    sheet on the side labeled “Mission Deck.”

    Shuffle one of each of the five different Project cards into the Empire’s Main Missions Deck.

    Place Starting Units and Loyalty
    Loyalty
    Shuffle the probe deck and reveal cards from the top of the deck until three Rebel systems and five Imperial systems have been revealed

    Place a Rebel loyalty marker in each of the three Rebel systems. Place a subjugation marker in the first two Imperial systems drawn and an Imperial loyalty
    marker in each of the other three Imperial systems drawn

    Return the five Imperial probe cards to the game box. Then shuffle all other probe cards back into the probe deck

    Empire Deployment
    Deploy the Empire Units as follows (use D6, as needed):

    2 TIE Fighters & 2 Stormtroopers in each of the initial six Systems
    Randomly deploy 3 Star Destroyers in 3 separate Systems (1 each); deploy 3 Assault Carriers in the remaining 3 Systems
    Randomly deploy 1 AT-AT to a System; then deploy 5 AT-STs (1 per System) in the remaining 5 Systems
    Randomly deploy the Death Star
    Rebel Deployment
    The Rebel player receives:

    1 Corellian Corvette
    1 Rebel Transport
    2 X-wings
    2 Y-wings
    6 Rebel Troopers
    2 Airspeeders
    These units can be placed in the “Rebel Base” space of the game board and/or in any one Rebel or neutral system

    Action Cards
    For both sides draw two random starting action cards (i.e., the action cards without a recruit icon on them). These cards provide special, once-per-game
    abilities

    Rebel Base
    The Solo Player chooses the Rebel Base’s location from among the 8 Remote Systems, after placing all Starting Units and Loyalty Markers. The Empire knows it
    is located in one of these Systems (acquired vital information through its intelligence networks), and will aggressively search for it

    Draw Starting Hand
    Take the four starting missions and draw two cards from the mission deck to create your starting hand
